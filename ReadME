- People need 5M Kendu per NFT mint
- we will mint 10K NFTs in all
- Once all 10K are minted we will add the base URL and reveal the NFTs
- We will start the marketplace
- The market place has ability for users to put up the nFT for Sale
- Others can submit a bid for the NFT
- Owner will accept it



- The market place collects a fee of 2.5% of each transaction
- if someone owns 3 nfts of 10,000, he will get 3/10,000 share of that fee



so if fee of 2.5% is 0.1ETh he will get 0.00003 ETH
